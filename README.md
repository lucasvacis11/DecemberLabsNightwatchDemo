Upgrades
There are several ways to upgrade this project to enhance its testing capabilities:
- POM : Since I do not have expirience with the framework and had to learn it from scratch it was prioritezed creating the test rather than apply best practices in order to accomplish the time line

Continuous Integration
Nightwatch is designed to work with continuous integration servers like Jenkins or CircleCI. Integrating your project with a CI server can help catch bugs early by running tests automatically whenever changes are pushed to your repository.
